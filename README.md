#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is field that deals with the systematic application of engineering aspects for the development and maintenace of software. In the tech industry it is fundamental as it gives you the methods and tools you need to make high-quality software that meets today's technological needs.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Structured Programming (1960sâ€“1970s): This introduced organised programming methods such as modules and control structures, which made code easier to read and maintain.

2. The "Waterfall Model" from the 1970s: It was one of the first organised ways to make software, and it focused on a step-by-step design process with clear steps like requirements, design, and testing.

3. In 2001, agile development ushered in a new era of iterative development methods that put customer collaboration and fast delivery at the top of the list. This changed the way software projects are managed and carried out in environments that are always changing.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


1. Requirement Analysis: getting user needs and writing them down.
2. Design: Making plans for the software's structure and parts.
3. Implementation: Making the program by writing and coding it.
4. Testing: Making sure the software works and finding bugs.
5. Deployment: Making the program available for people to use.
6. Maintenance:Adding features and fixing bugs in the program after it has been deployed.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Government systems are prime examples of projects that benefit greatly from the linear, sequential nature of the waterfall methodology. Agile is iterative, encouraging adaptability and client input, this makes it perfect for projects that are dynamic and have changing requirements, like software companies. Agile's flexibility flourishes in projects that move quickly and require innovation, whereas Waterfall's rigidity is better suited for controlled settings.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A Software Developer develops and manages code, putting features into use according to design guidelines. The software is tested by a Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer to find errors and make sure it satisfies quality requirements. In order to make sure the project stays on track with objectives and deadlines, a Project Manager organises the team, controls schedules, resources, and communication. Together, they guarantee the software is produced effectively, satisfies specifications, and is of the highest calibre.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) such as Visual Studio Code, improve productivity by providing code editors, debuggers, and autocompletion, among other tools that expedite the coding process. Git and other Version Control Systems (VCS) are essential for managing code changes, facilitating teamwork, and preserving project history. By decreasing errors and promoting teamwork, IDEs and VCS work together to promote effective, coordinated, and collaborative software development.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
some common challenges faced by sofware engineers are based on issues like lack of resources for examples a new software that is essential for a project, this comes as a lack of funds to sponsor their projects. A strategy to overcome this is simply get into a community of fellow software engineers who can collectively acquire those resources.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Integration Testing makes that joined modules function as a unit, whereas **Unit Testing verifies the accuracy of individual components. The entire software is validated against specifications through System Testing. Acceptance Testing verifies that the program satisfies business requirements and user expectations. Each kind is essential to software quality assurance because it can spot flaws at different phases, guaranteeing that the program is dependable, operational, and satisfies all needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of creating accurate and useful inputs (prompts) to direct AI models in producing desired results. In order to maximise AI performance and guarantee precise, pertinent, and context-aware responses, it is needed. Well-crafted prompts increase the quality of responses, lessen uncertainty, and improve user experience when dealing with AI. This increases the AI's usefulness across a range of applications, including chatbots, content creation, and decision support systems.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: explore about climate change.

Improved prompt: "Explain how human activities contribute to climate change and suggest three strategies for reducing its impact."

Why it is more effective: The new prompt identifies the focus (human activities and reduction measures), allowing the AI to respond in a more thorough and appropriate manner. This clarity guarantees that the information is exact and actionable, increasing the value of the output.
